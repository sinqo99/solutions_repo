# Problem 3

# 1. Introduction to Trajectories Near Earth

When a payload is released near Earth from a moving rocket, its trajectory depends on several factors:

- **Initial Position**: The starting point of the payload relative to Earth.
- **Initial Velocity**: The speed and direction of the payload when released.
- **Gravitational Forces**: The Earth’s gravitational field acting on the payload.
- **Orbital Mechanics Principles**: Newton’s Law of Gravitation, Kepler’s Laws, and the concepts of escape velocity and orbital insertion.

# 2. Orbital Mechanics Fundamentals

## Gravitational Force

According to Newton's Law of Gravitation:

$$
F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}
$$

Where:

- \( F \) is the gravitational force.
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant.
- \( M \) is the mass of Earth.
- \( m \) is the mass of the payload.
- \( r \) is the distance between the center of the Earth and the payload.

## Equations of Motion

The motion of the payload is governed by Newton's second law, where the gravitational force provides the acceleration:

$$
F = ma = \frac{GMm}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

This leads to the second-order differential equations that describe the position and velocity of the payload over time. These equations are usually solved numerically because they involve non-linear terms due to the \( r^2 \) dependence in the gravitational force.

## Escape Velocity

The escape velocity is the minimum speed needed for an object to escape Earth's gravitational field, and it can be computed using:

$$
v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}
$$

Where:

- \( v_e \) is the escape velocity.
- \( r \) is the distance from the center of Earth.

## Orbital Types

Based on the velocity of the object relative to Earth's gravity, the trajectory can be:

- **Elliptical**: If the object's velocity is less than the escape velocity.
- **Parabolic**: If the velocity is exactly equal to the escape velocity.
- **Hyperbolic**: If the object's velocity is greater than the escape velocity.

# 3. Numerical Simulation Approach

We’ll use Python to implement the simulation. The goal is to numerically solve the equations of motion for a payload under Earth’s gravitational field.

## 3.1 Initial Setup

We'll assume the following initial conditions for simplicity:

- **Initial position** \( r_0 = (x_0, y_0, z_0) \).
- **Initial velocity** \( v_0 = (v_x, v_y, v_z) \).
- **Earth's gravitational constant** \( G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \).
- **Earth's mass** \( M = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \).
- **Earth's radius** \( R = 6371 \, \text{km} \).

## 3.2 Solving the Equations of Motion

We’ll solve the following system of equations numerically:

$$
r''(t) = -\frac{GM}{|r(t)|^3} r(t)
$$

This requires discretizing time and numerically solving for the position and velocity at each timestep using a numerical integrator like Runge-Kutta or Euler's method.

## 3.3 Visualization

We will visualize the trajectory using matplotlib in Python, creating plots that show the path of the payload, its velocity vector, and the Earth’s gravitational influence.

# Understanding Orbital Trajectories - Simplified Explanation

These four graphs show how objects (like satellites or rockets) move when they are launched from Earth. They help us understand how different speeds create different types of paths around or away from the Earth.

---

## Top Left: Orbital Paths Around Earth

- This graph shows three types of paths:
  - **Blue (Elliptical):** The object stays in orbit around Earth. It goes around in an oval shape.
  - **Green (Parabolic):** The object just barely escapes Earth’s gravity. It follows a path that’s right on the edge between staying and escaping.
  - **Red (Hyperbolic):** The object moves fast enough to escape Earth and never come back.
- The **orange circle** is Earth. All the paths start near Earth and show what happens depending on how fast the object moves.

---

## Top Right: Escape Speed vs. Distance

- This graph shows how fast an object needs to go to escape Earth’s gravity.
- The farther away the object starts, the **less speed** it needs to escape.
- This is because gravity gets weaker as you move away from Earth.

---

## Bottom Left: Velocity Vectors

- This graph shows the **speed and direction** of the object at different points along its path.
- Each arrow shows how the object is moving:
  - **Elliptical (Blue):** The speed changes depending on how close it is to Earth.
  - **Parabolic (Green):** The speed gradually decreases as it moves away.
  - **Hyperbolic (Red):** The object keeps moving fast and doesn’t slow down much.

---

## Bottom Right: Distance from Earth Over Time

- This graph shows how far the object is from Earth as time passes:
  - **Elliptical (Blue):** The distance goes up and down. The object is in orbit and keeps coming back around.
  - **Parabolic (Green):** The object keeps moving away, but slowly.
  - **Hyperbolic (Red):** The object moves away quickly and keeps going farther and farther.

---

## Conclusion

These graphs show how an object’s speed decides whether it stays around Earth or escapes into space. If it moves slowly, it stays in orbit. If it moves fast enough, it can escape. This is how satellites, space probes, and rockets behave depending on how much energy they are given at launch.
