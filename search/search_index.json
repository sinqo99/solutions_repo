Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is governed by the basic equations of motion under constant acceleration due to gravity. To derive the equations, we consider two components of motion: horizontal (x-direction) and vertical (y-direction). 1.1 Equations of Motion In projectile motion, the only force acting on the projectile (ignoring air resistance) is gravity, which accelerates the object downward with a constant acceleration, \\( g \\) . The horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other. We can describe each with kinematic equations: Horizontal motion (no acceleration) : $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t $$ where: \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity, \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of projection, \\( t \\) is time. Vertical motion (constant acceleration due to gravity) : $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ 1.2 Time of Flight To find the time of flight, we need to determine when the projectile hits the ground, i.e., when \\( y(t) = 0 \\) . Using the vertical motion equation: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 = 0 \\] Factoring out \\( t \\) , we get: \\[ t (v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2} g t) = 0 \\] The solutions are \\( t = 0 \\) (the initial launch) and \\( t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\) (the time when the projectile hits the ground). Thus, the time of flight is: \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] 1.3 Horizontal Range The horizontal range \\( R \\) is the distance traveled in the horizontal direction during the time of flight. From the horizontal motion equation: \\[ R = x(t_f) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t_f \\] Substituting the expression for \\( t_f \\) : \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Simplifying: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] 1.4 Family of Solutions This equation shows how the range \\( R \\) depends on the initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) , the gravitational acceleration \\( g \\) , and the launch angle \\( \\theta \\) . The term \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) shows that the range is maximized when \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) because \\( \\sin(90^\\circ) = 1 \\) . Thus, for a given \\( v_0 \\) and \\( g \\) , the range depends on the launch angle. The solution also highlights that the range is symmetric: for any angle \\( \\theta \\) , there is a complementary angle \\( 90^\\circ - \\theta \\) that gives the same range. 2. Analysis of the Range 2.1 Dependence on Launch Angle From the derived equation \\( R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\) , we can see that the horizontal range is a function of \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) . Therefore, the range is: Maximized at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) , where \\( \\sin(90^\\circ) = 1 \\) . Zero at \\( \\theta = 0^\\circ \\) and \\( \\theta = 90^\\circ \\) , since \\( \\sin(0^\\circ) = 0 \\) and \\( \\sin(180^\\circ) = 0 \\) . Symmetrical around \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . 2.2 Dependence on Initial Velocity and Gravitational Acceleration From the equation for the range, we observe that the range \\( R \\) is directly proportional to the square of the initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) and inversely proportional to the gravitational acceleration \\( g \\) . Therefore: Initial velocity : As \\( v_0 \\) increases, the range increases quadratically. This implies that doubling the initial velocity quadruples the range. Gravitational acceleration : The range decreases with an increase in gravitational acceleration, so on a planet with stronger gravity, the range of a projectile would be shorter. 3. Practical Applications This model is a simplified version of projectile motion, which assumes no air resistance and level ground. In real-world applications, several factors influence projectile motion: Air resistance : Drag forces reduce the horizontal range and make the trajectory curve differently. The more streamlined the projectile, the less drag it experiences. Uneven terrain : The model assumes level ground, but if the projectile is launched at an incline or on a hill, the calculations become more complex. Wind : Wind can modify both the trajectory and range by altering the horizontal velocity of the projectile. 4.
